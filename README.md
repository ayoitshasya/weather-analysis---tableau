The "Weather Analysis using Python and Tableau" project involves correlation and regression analysis to study weather patterns. Correlation matrices and heatmaps identify key relationships, while scatter matrices provide deeper insights into pairwise relationships among weather parameters. Linear regression models are used to predict variables like 'MaxTemp,' 'Humidity3pm,' and 'Rainfall'.
